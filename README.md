# NLP

## NLP Text Preprocessing Project â€“ Overview
This project demonstrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing techniques, implemented in Python. Each step plays a critical role in preparing unstructured text for downstream NLP tasks like classification, sentiment analysis, and information extraction.

**The code has been uploaded to this repository â€” feel free to explore and run it on your own datasets!**

** Key NLP Preprocessing Steps
## Text Extraction:
Extracts raw text from structured or unstructured formats (e.g., PDFs, HTML, DOCX). Itâ€™s the starting point to get the data into a processable form.

## Synonym Replacement:
Replaces words with their synonyms using a thesaurus (like WordNet). Useful for augmenting datasets or standardizing vocabulary.

## Back Translation:
Translates a sentence to another language and back to its original language. Often used for data augmentation and paraphrasing in NLP tasks.

## Entity Replacement:
Identifies and replaces named entities (like names, dates, locations) with generic tokens (e.g., <PERSON>, <DATE>), which improves model generalization and privacy.

## Unicode Normalization:
Ensures that all characters are in a consistent encoding format, especially useful when handling special characters or multilingual text.

## Spell Correction:
Fixes common typos and misspellings using libraries like TextBlob, SymSpell, or pyspellchecker, improving token consistency.

## Sentence Segmentation:
Splits paragraphs into sentences using punctuation or pretrained sentence boundary detectors (like SpaCy or NLTK). Prepares text for sentence-level analysis.

## Tokenization:
Breaks down text into individual units (tokens), such as words or subwords. This is a fundamental step before applying models or transformations.

## Stop-Word Removal:
Eliminates common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that carry little semantic value, helping reduce noise in the text.

## Normalization:
Includes text cleaning techniques like lowercasing, removing punctuation, numbers, and extra spaces. Ensures consistency across the dataset.

## Stemming:
Reduces words to their root form by chopping off suffixes (e.g., "running" â†’ "run"). Itâ€™s a rule-based process and may create non-dictionary roots.

## Lemmatization:
Converts words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "am", "is", "are" â†’ "be") using vocabulary and grammar context. Itâ€™s more accurate than stemming.

## ðŸ§ª Tools/Libraries Used:
NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, re, unicodedata, translate, wordnet, etc.
